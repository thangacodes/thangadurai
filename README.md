# ðŸ’« About Me:
I am Thangadurai, a seasoned Information Technology engineer and a graduate of Anna University in Tamil Nadu, India, with over 13 years of experience specializing in AWS Cloud and DevOps. 
As a Senior Engineer, my focus is on enhancing cloud infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), specifically with Terraform, and establishing robust environments for SaaS applications. 
This experience builds on my previous roles at Sabre Airline Solutions and Tesco Bank, where I excelled in developing and maintaining continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines. 
I leveraged tools such as GitHub, GitHub Actions, CloudBees Jenkins CI/CD, Ansible, IBM WebSpehere, Apache Tomcat, Terraform (IaC), and Oracle/Postgres databases migrations and upgrades to streamline software delivery for clients in the airline and banking industries.

The technical prowess I bring to the table is buttressed by expertise in cloud services, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, and configuration management. 
Our team's commitment to innovation and seamless operations has resulted in efficient and secure development workflows. 
Contributing to such transformative projects has honed my skills in scripting with Python and Groovy, maximized system reliability, and optimized the deployment process, aligning with Tesco's objectives of advancing their technological framework.
